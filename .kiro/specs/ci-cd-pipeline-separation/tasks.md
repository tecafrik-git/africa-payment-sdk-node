# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Restructure pipeline.yml to separate build and publish into distinct jobs
  - Modify the existing pipeline.yml file to create two separate jobs: `build` and `publish`
  - Move existing build steps (checkout, setup, install, test, build) into the `build` job
  - Move publish step into the `publish` job with all necessary setup steps
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Configure publish job with conditional execution and dependencies
  - Add `needs: build` to the publish job to create dependency on build job
  - Add `if: github.event_name == 'push'` conditional to the publish job
  - Ensure publish job includes all necessary steps: checkout, setup with registry-url, install, test, build, and publish
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Add descriptive job and step names for clarity
  - Update job names to be clear and descriptive ("Build" and "Publish")
  - Ensure all steps have clear, descriptive names
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.5_
